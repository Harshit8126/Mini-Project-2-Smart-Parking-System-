# Mini-Project-2-Smart-Parking-System-

## Problem Statement : 

**Nowadays most of the car parks require userâ€™s initiative to search for empty space to park their car. This will cause problems when it is too many cars and it makes them wasting their time and energy. One of the factors that contribute to this problem is because of lack of information that given at parking lot. So, one system has to be design to solve this parking problem which will include the information interface criteria.Nowadays in most of the countries, Parking Information and Guidance (PGI) system have been put into practice in Europe, United State, Japan, and China. Number of cars on the road is increasing while parking spaces are becoming increasingly scarce. Usually during school break or holiday, the numbers of cars that use the parking space in the shopping complex become higher compared to during working day. This will make the parking space become full and the driver need to drive slowly in order for them to check for the free space parking in the shopping complex. This is time consuming and people will become more impatient. Besides that, there are also problems of the parking space which are located far from the entering zone or the building or destination. This situation makes the drivers to choose the nearest parking space as they do not want to walk far.As the fuel price is keep increase nowadays, users will try their best to save their vehicle energy. At the peak hour, they need to wait for a long time at the entrance gate before they can find the empty parking space. So the users will waste their time and energy to find a free space. Last but not least, the major issue of the parking system is the insufficient parking spaces provided for the user. This may cause by the improper planning by developers of the places. When the parking bay is on its peak hour, the user will search the parking space at the same area again and again before they found it, only if they are lucky. Sometimes, the car park management did not put a notice that the area was full and no more space for parking**
